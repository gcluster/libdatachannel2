To get libdatachannels source, do this:

1. as per the libdatachannel web page:
  git clone https://github.com/gcluster/libdatachannel.git
  cd libdatachannel
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  optionally delete the examples directory (not used and skipped in build)

2. run cmake
  cmake -B build-win -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64 -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR:PATH="c:\projects\hila\ext\openssl"

3. open build-win\libdatachannel.sln, for Debug and RelWithDbgInfo configurations:
  - fix openssl library link settings
  - add crypt32.lib to additional dependencies for libdatachannel
  - make all include paths relative to $(ProjectDir) 
  - remove other projects than datachannel, datachannel-client, juice-static, srtp2, usrstcp from the solution
